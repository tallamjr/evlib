I ultimately want evlib to be the one stop shop for event based vision utilities
as well as a place where many of the state of the art algorithms have been
implemented and reside.

Events to Video algorithms (vid2e) I would like to implement are:

- [E2VID](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_e2vid)
- [FireNet](https://github.com/cedric-scheerlinck/rpg_e2vid/tree/cedric/firenet)
- [E2VID+](https://github.com/TimoStoff/event_cnn_minimal)
- [FireNet+](https://github.com/TimoStoff/event_cnn_minimal)
- [SPADE-E2VID](https://github.com/RodrigoGantier/SPADE_E2VID)
- [SSL-E2VID](https://github.com/tudelft/ssl_e2vid)
- [ET-Net](https://github.com/WarranWeng/ET-Net)
- [HyperE2VID](https://github.com/ercanburak/HyperE2VID)

They all should use Candle framework to re-implement the architecture and use
existing pytorch model files where possible. We can leverage either the existing
PyTorch loader (pytorch_loader.rs) or ONNX Runtime (ort) for model inference.

https://github.com/ercanburak/EVREAL does a good job of comparing the different
algorithms and points to many good resources. I would like all of these
algorithms to have their implementation at: `evlib/src/ev_processing/reconstruction/`

After that my plan is to implement the functionality found here that does the
reverse, i.e Video to Events and works as a simulator. The main repo for this
can be found here: https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_e2vid

A useful set of open-source tooling can be found here:
https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/dv-processing. I would like to eventually
incorporate the functionality there inside evlib too.

A project that is aiming to do similar things is
https://github.com/ucsd-hdsi-dvs/V2CE-Toolbox, maybe you can draw inspiration
from how they do things.

Of course there is also https://github.com/prophesee-ai/openeb too and
https://github.com/shiba24/event-vision-library and actually there is a good
amount of tooling found here too: https://github.com/tub-rip/ETAP
